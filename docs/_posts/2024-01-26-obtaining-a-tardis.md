## Growing A TARDIS Coral
Some prior information, you will need to obtain **soul sand** and a **nether star**, 
plus a good trek to find a [**rift chunk**]({% post_url 2024-01-26-rift-chunk %}) in the world before you can begin the process.

1. To start, you will need to craft a TARDIS Coral (top right).

2. Once a [**rift chunk**]({% post_url 2024-01-26-rift-chunk %}) is found, you will need to use a **soul sand** block that is exposed to direct skylight (middle right).

3. Now once you have placed the coral down, you will need to wait for anywhere between 3-12 minutes (this is also dependent entirely on tick speed).

## Restoring the TARDIS
The TARDIS will be ***unusable*** until it has rematerialised and selected a random interior/exterior after the **nether star** has been used.

1. Once grown, the coral will present you with a door into the interior dimension it has grown from the [**artron energy**]({% post_url 2024-01-26-artron-energy %}) in the rift.

2. Walk inside the growth, and - once inside - find any water, and toss your **nether star** into it.
