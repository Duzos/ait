## Console Generator
Using a **Console Generator** is the only way to get a console. 
Use it in the interior to select any of the unlocked consoles that exist.
1. *Right click* on the generator to change the **type**.
2. *Crouch right click* on the generator to change the **variant**.
3. *Confirm the console* by using a linked **Sonic Screwdriver**.

## What Is It?
The TARDIS Console, quite simply, is the interface that which a player (or other entity) uses to interact with the TARDIS itself.
Out-of-universe, the console is a collection of [*"control entities"*]({% post_url 2024-01-26-control-entities %}) that do different functions.

## How Is It Used?
Right or left click on any of the controls to activate them. Certain controls - like the throttle - need you to crouch to increment them up or down.

The increment control is a little special; it goes from 1-10-100-1000, and you *can* crouch to go down and not to go up the scale.

If you're having a hard time finding the controls, you can use a **Sonic Screwdriver** in **SCANNING** mode to view their names around the console.

Alternatively, you're able to turn on debug mode for viewing entity **hitboxes**, using F3+B will toggle the debug **hitbox** mode.

the coordinate system (X, Y and Z) need you to crouch to make the number of the increment go subtract from the current position.
