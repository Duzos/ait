**Requires [OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**

## Summary
**Apparatus Vivi. Living machine. TARDIS from Doctor Who. Whatever you call it, it grows with you. It learns with you, and flies the way you fly. Sure, you might be the pilot, but despite that, it does with that what it may.**

## What does this mod do?

### TODO - make this

## Compatability
### If you have [Regeneration](https://modrinth.com/mod/regeneration)
- Adds special functionality when you regenerate inside a tardis
- Your TARDIS will panic, crashing and flying randomly.
- Your TARDIS may randomly change interior or exterior
### If you have [Immersive Portals](https://modrinth.com/mod/immersiveportals)
- Your TARDIS will be Bigger on the Inside (BOTI)
- When you open the doors from the exterior you will be able to see the interior and vice versa
